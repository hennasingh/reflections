Reflection 01
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i dont have my own laptop or when i am working on public machine or friends laptop, its better to work directly on remote
repository rather than wait to work on local machine, changes can be easily synced later

Reflection 02
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
the manual pull gives us a choice what changes we needed to pull and what can be left specially when there is huge code in the repository and 
sometimes there can be space crunch which may prove fatal.
