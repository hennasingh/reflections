Reflection 01
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when any repository gets initialized with with git init, a hidden metadeta .git file is created
which helps in keeping the track of all changes done to the files in the directory.

Reflection 02
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a part of git and it keeps the files before a commit is done on it.Files can be added 
to staging area by using git add command and similarly git status can be used to check the status of the files.
while a working directory is a store of files which have not been committed yet after the changes have been made
while repository stores metadeta about all the history of the files since they were created.

Reflection 03
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use git diff commands to check the editions made to the code since last commit, i can check the status of the file and check 
differences between working directory and staging area as well.
